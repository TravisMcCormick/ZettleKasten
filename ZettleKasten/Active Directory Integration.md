    - Enables single sign-on (SSO) across multiple applications and services.
2. **User and Group Management:**
    - Facilitates the creation, modification, and deletion of user accounts and groups.
3. **Policy Enforcement:**
    - Applies security policies and access controls uniformly across integrated systems.
4. **Resource Management:**
    - Manages access to network resources such as files, printers, and applications.
5. **Directory Services:**
    - Provides a hierarchical structure for organizing network resources and user information.

### **Importance in Networking**

- **Security Enhancement:** Centralizes authentication and authorization, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Simplifies user management and policy enforcement across the network.
- **Scalability:** Supports the growth of the network by easily integrating new services and applications.

### **Personal Insight**

Integrating systems with Active Directory significantly streamlines user management and enhances security. It’s essential for organizations looking to maintain control over their IT environment while providing seamless access to resources.
