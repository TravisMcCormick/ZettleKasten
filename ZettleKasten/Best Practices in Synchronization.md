### **Definition**

Best practices in synchronization refer to the recommended strategies and methodologies for managing access to shared resources in concurrent programming. These practices aim to prevent race conditions, ensure data consistency, and optimize performance.

### **Common Pitfalls**

- **Overusing Locks:** Can lead to reduced performance and increased contention.
- **Deadlocks:** Improper lock management can create circular dependencies.
- **Race Conditions:** Unsynchronized access to shared data can cause inconsistent states.

### **Strategies**

- **Minimize Lock Scope:** Keep the critical section as small as possible.
- **Use Appropriate Primitives:** Select the right synchronization tools like mutexes, semaphores, or condition variables.
- **Prefer Lock-Free Structures:** When possible, use data structures that don't require locks to reduce contention.
- **Consistent Lock Ordering:** Establish and follow a global order for acquiring multiple locks.

### **Examples**

- **Immutable Objects:** Designing objects that cannot be modified after creation to avoid synchronization.
- **Thread Pools:** Managing a limited number of threads to control resource usage and synchronization overhead.
