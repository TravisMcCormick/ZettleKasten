Cursor is an AI-powered coding assistant designed to enhance developer productivity through context-aware code exploration, real-time suggestions, and seamless integration with existing IDEs. Unlike generic large language models, Cursor emphasizes “cursor-centric” interactions: it interprets the developer’s current cursor position to infer intent, offering precise refactorings, API lookups, and in-line documentation. Positioned as a force multiplier for code comprehension, Cursor bridges the gap between static reference documentation and dynamic development workflows, enabling engineers to stay focused without context switching.
