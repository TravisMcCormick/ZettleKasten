**Use Cases:**
- **On-the-fly refactoring:** Automatically restructure code blocks based on best practices.
- **API discovery:** Surface relevant library functions and usage examples without leaving the editor.
- **Code summarization:** Generate concise comments or documentation for selected code regions.

**Limitations:**
- **Context scope:** Performance degrades on very large files where cursor context is insufficient.
- **Creativity constraints:** Struggles with high-level architectural design or domain-specific conventions.
- **Data privacy:** Requires careful handling of proprietary codebases to avoid model data leakage.

Future enhancements may include project-wide analysis and integration with CI pipelines for continuous code health monitoring.
