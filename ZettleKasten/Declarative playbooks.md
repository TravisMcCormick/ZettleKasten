### **Definition**

**Declarative playbooks** are YAML files that describe the desired end state of a system—packages, files, services—instead of imperative step-by-step commands. This approach focuses on "what" the system should look like rather than "how" to get there.

### **Characteristics**

- Define desired state, not procedures
- Idempotent by design (can be run multiple times safely)
- More maintainable and readable
- Infrastructure as code approach
