An **endpoint** is a distinct access point within a networked system or software architecture where communication originates or terminates. In networking, it refers to any device or node—such as a server, workstation, router, or IoT sensor—that holds an IP address and listens for or initiates traffic on specific ports. In software development (especially RESTful APIs and microservices), an endpoint is a unique URL or URI mapped to a specific resource or operation, defining where clients send requests and receive responses.

### Key characteristics:
- **Addressability:** Each endpoint has a unique network address (IP + port) or URI path.
- **Protocol specificity:** Endpoints adhere to defined communication protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP, WebSocket).
- **Function contract:** In coding, an endpoint embodies a contract specifying allowable methods (GET, POST, etc.), required parameters, expected payload formats (JSON, XML), and response schemas.
- **Security boundary:** Endpoints represent security enforcement points enforcing authentication, authorization, encryption, and rate limiting.
