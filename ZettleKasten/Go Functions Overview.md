### Definition

Functions are core building blocks in Go. They encapsulate logic into reusable units, supporting arguments, return values, pointers, variadic parameters, and named returns. Functions are first-class citizens in Go, meaning they can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables.
