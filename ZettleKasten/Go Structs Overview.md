### Definition

Structures (structs) in Go define custom composite data types, grouping fields and enabling methods, embedding, and metadata via tags. They support static typing, zero-value initialization, pointers for references, and interact with interfaces for polymorphism. Unlike classes in other languages, Go uses composition and interfaces over inheritance and relies on garbage collection for memory management.
