**Compared to Python Classes**
- Go structs are **static**; you cannot add fields at runtime.
- Fields are **statically typed** in Go vs. dynamic typing in Python.
- Go uses constructor functions or literals; Python has `__init__`.
- Go enforces package-level privacy; Python uses naming conventions.

**Compared to Python Dicts**
- Dicts are dynamic key-value maps; structs have fixed schema and field types.
- Dict access is via `map[key]` lookup; struct access is direct dot notation.
- Structs offer compile-time safety and performance; dicts offer runtime flexibility.
