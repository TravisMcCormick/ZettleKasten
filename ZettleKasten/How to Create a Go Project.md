### 1. Basic Steps to Create a Go Project

When you start a new Go project, you usually do:

```bash
go mod init <module-name>
```

and then

```bash
go mod tidy
```

Here's what each command actually does:

---

### 2. `go mod init <module-name>`

- **Purpose**: Initializes a new Go module in your current directory.
- **What it does**:
    - Creates a `go.mod` file.
    - The `go.mod` file records:
        - The module name (like a package namespace).
        - The Go version you are targeting.
            
- **Why it matters**:
    - Go modules are the modern way to handle dependencies and versioning.
    - They make your project self-contained.

Example:

```bash
go mod init main
```

This will create `go.mod` containing:

```go
module main  go 1.22
```

### 3. `go mod tidy`

- **Purpose**: Cleans up your `go.mod` and `go.sum` files.
- **What it does**:
    - Adds missing dependencies used in your code.
    - Removes dependencies you no longer use.
    - Creates or updates the `go.sum` file, which locks down exact versions for reproducibility.
- **Why it matters**:
    - Keeps your module's dependency graph correct and lean.
    - Ensures your builds are reproducible across different environments.

### 4. Other Useful Things You Can Do

**Create a basic project structure**:

```bash
mkdir cmd pkg internal touch cmd/main.go
```

Explanation:

- `cmd/` - Your application entry point(s).
- `pkg/` - Reusable Go packages for external use.
- `internal/` - Reusable Go packages for internal project use only.

**Initialize Git** (recommended):

```bash
git init
```

This helps you track code changes and makes it easier to upload the project to a repository like GitHub.

**Install VSCode Extensions**:

- Install the **Go** extension (official, by Google)
- It provides IntelliSense, linting, debugging, and code navigation.

**Set Up Basic Linting/Formatting**: Inside VSCode settings, enable:

- `gofmt` (built-in formatter)
- `golangci-lint` (for advanced linting)

**Optionally Create a Makefile for Automation**: Example `Makefile`:

```Makefile
run: go run ./cmd/main.go  
build: go build -o bin/app ./cmd/main.go  
tidy: go mod tidy
```
