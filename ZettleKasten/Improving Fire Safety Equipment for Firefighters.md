### Definition

This note explores proposals for **improving fire safety equipment for firefighters** through the integration of augmented reality and GPS tracking technologies. The proposals are motivated by the tragic 2007 Charleston Sofa Store fire and aim to reduce firefighter casualties through technological innovation.

### Key Proposals

1. **Augmented Reality SCBA Masks**: Display oxygen levels and vital information directly in the firefighter's line of sight
2. **GPS Tracking Integration**: Real-time location tracking and mapping for firefighters inside structures
3. **Enhanced PASS Device Integration**: Improved alert and location systems

For as far back as the 2nd century, firefighting has been a necessity within society. Though the times have changed, the initial calls to serve and protect resonate within the hearts of every member of fire rescue when they make an oath to risk their lives to protect their communities.

Growing up, I understood these values well as my grandfather — a firefighter for 46 years and now a fire marshal in Deland, Florida — taught me what it’s like to be a firefighter. Due to this upbringing and seeing the extreme dangers firefighters face daily, I developed a deep concern for fire safety. I have learned of many incidents that led to firefighters losing their lives in tragic ways throughout the years. One such incident happened just 14 years ago in Charleston, South Carolina, where nine brave men lost their lives in what could be called the worst fire since the attacks on 9/11.[1]

Within this devastating incident, nine firefighters entered a sofa factory engulfed in flames, searching for any trapped employees. Without knowing only one employee was left inside, the firefighters went in to search. Shortly after, the employee was rescued by breaking an exterior wall and pulling him through.[1] Only a couple of minutes later, radios were filled with the cries of the nine firefighters as they called for help — they had been inside for nearly half an hour and were running low on air. The scene’s fire chief called for a complete evacuation, but then a flashover occurred, sending fire shooting out of all the windows. Despite their attempts, the fire was too strong to send in more firefighters for rescue.[1] 

When my grandfather told me this story, it shocked me. The fierce fires that firefighters face left me determined to develop equipment that could lower firefighter death rates as much as possible.

## Integrating Technology with Firefighting Equipment

As a STEM student, I am highly technological and began thinking of ways to integrate firefighting equipment with advanced technology. While conducting research, I studied the Charleston tragedy and explored what could have helped those men that day. This led to extensive research on existing firefighter equipment and how it might be improved.

Through this process, I met with Fire Inspector **Taylor Riley**, who generously discussed my ideas and helped me assess their logistical feasibility. Riley introduced me to his coworker, **Fire Inspector Zakary Scripter**. Both inspectors explained how their equipment functions and their tactics during fires. 

While they described their gear, I was fascinated by the **PASS device** worn on their packs. The PASS device serves several functions, but most notably, it shows a digital display of air remaining in the firefighter’s tank, air usage per breath, and a rough estimate of how long the tank will last. This concerned me because the men in the Charleston warehouse were running out of oxygen.[1]

Riley and Scripter explained that the PASS device sits on the chest, with LED indicators showing oxygen levels. However, these LEDs are located at the bottom of a firefighter’s vision, requiring them to look down — something that often doesn’t happen in high-intensity situations. I asked whether **augmented reality (AR) masks** were available or being developed. Riley and Scripter admitted no such technology existed to their knowledge. Later, I discovered that **augmented motorcycle helmets** were being developed to improve rider safety on roads.[2] 

I firmly believe that if similar technology were implemented into firefighters’ **SCBA masks**, many lives could be saved. While I recognize the differences between driving and running into burning buildings, if oxygen levels were displayed in a clearer, more intuitive manner, fewer firefighters would find themselves in deadly situations.

## Implementing GPS Tracking for Firefighters

Another critical issue I noticed while researching the Charleston fire was the **lack of GPS tracking**. In a world where we can locate misplaced keys using small tracking tags, it’s concerning that we can’t do the same for firefighters in dangerous environments.

Using GPS technology could provide a **live feed of each firefighter’s location**, and with sufficient integration, could map where they’ve been. This would allow new teams arriving on the scene to quickly assess which areas have been searched and where to focus. 

Currently, according to Inspectors Riley and Scripter, there are only a few methods for locating a downed firefighter. The first is through **radio communication**, which is often unreliable due to masks, noise, and heat. If a firefighter can communicate, they can direct rescuers — but disorientation and crawling make this method highly inaccurate.

Inspector Riley mentioned that during drills, firefighters are blindfolded and told to crawl in a straight line, then return to their starting point. Almost none return to the exact location, demonstrating how easily spatial awareness is lost in smoke-filled environments.

The second method is through the **PASS alarm system**, which triggers if a firefighter hasn’t moved for about 45 seconds. The alarm grows louder and more piercing over time. However, this method forces rescuers to rely on **echolocation**, which can be extremely inefficient. 

Integrating **GPS tracking** could allow for rapid and accurate location of any downed firefighter. Furthermore, GPS could guide firefighters to the nearest exit in emergencies — potentially preventing tragedies like Charleston.

## Funding and Feasibility

While these solutions are not ready for immediate implementation, the **research and development funding** required to create or purchase such technologies exceeds most counties’ budgets. Therefore, the primary challenge is securing the funding to explore cost-effective and practical methods that firefighters will actually adopt.

Companies like **Draeger**, which invest heavily in fire safety innovation, could lead the charge. If developed properly, AR-integrated masks and GPS tracking systems could revolutionize how firefighters operate, saving countless lives. 

My grandfather’s experience reflects the urgent need for continuous improvement. He suffers from asthma caused by smoke inhalation and deafness in one ear due to inadequate ear protection — issues that modern regulations now address. Technology evolves rapidly, and what’s advanced today will be obsolete tomorrow. Thus, we must innovate proactively, developing safer and smarter systems for those who risk everything to protect us.
