- **Wafer Locks**: Use flat wafers instead of pins. Common in automotive and office environments.
- **Disc Detainer Locks**: Employ rotating discs to prevent unlocking. Often found in high-security applications.
- **Lever Locks**: Use a series of levers to secure the lock. Predominantly used in older buildings and safes.
- **Electronic Locks**: Incorporate electronic components for access control, often featuring keypads or biometric scanners.

#### **Specialized Lock Types**

- **High-Security Locks**: Incorporate additional features like anti-pick pins, sidebars, and restricted keyways to enhance security.
- **Smart Locks**: Offer connectivity features such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi for remote access and monitoring.
- **Mortise Locks**: Installed within a mortise in the door, providing robust security for commercial applications.

#### **Security Considerations**

- **Complexity and Vulnerability**: More complex locks like disc detainer and high-security locks offer better resistance against picking and bumping.
- **Installation Environment**: Selecting appropriate lock types based on usage context and security requirements.

#### **Personal Insight**
