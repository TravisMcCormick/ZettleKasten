### **Definition**

An OrthoLinear keyboard layout is a type of keyboard design where the keys are arranged in a grid with uniform spacing, as opposed to the staggered arrangement found in traditional keyboards. This layout aims to reduce finger movement, increase typing efficiency, and minimize strain, potentially leading to faster and more comfortable typing experiences.

### **Advantages**

- **Reduced Finger Movement:** Straight columns allow fingers to move vertically, minimizing lateral movement.
- **Ergonomic Benefits:** Can decrease finger strain and repetitive stress injuries.
- **Consistency:** Uniform key spacing simplifies key mapping and muscle memory.

### **Disadvantages**

- **Learning Curve:** Users accustomed to QWERTY or other staggered layouts may find it challenging to adapt.
- **Availability:** Fewer manufacturers produce ortholinear keyboards, limiting choices.
- **Key Placement:** Some argue that the grid layout doesn't optimize key placement based on letter frequency.

### **Comparison with QWERTY**

- **Key Arrangement:** QWERTY has a staggered layout designed to prevent mechanical key clashes, whereas ortholinear keyboards use a grid.
- **Typing Speed:** Proponents claim ortholinear layouts can lead to faster typing once mastered, though evidence is anecdotal.
- **Ergonomics:** Ortholinear layouts are often marketed as more ergonomic, but individual preferences vary.

### **User Experience**

- **Customization:** Many ortholinear keyboards support programmability, allowing users to customize key functions.
- **Build Quality:** Enthusiast-grade ortholinear keyboards often feature high-quality materials and mechanical switches.
- **Aesthetics:** The grid layout offers a minimalist and modern appearance.

### **Popular Models**

- **Planck:** A compact 40% ortholinear keyboard popular in the mechanical keyboard community.
- **Preonic:** A slightly larger ortholinear keyboard with more keys for additional functionality.
- **ErgoDox EZ:** While not strictly ortholinear, it offers a split and customizable layout with some ortholinear features.
