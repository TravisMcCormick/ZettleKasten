- **Deadbolts**: Add an extra layer of security by reinforcing the locking mechanism.

#### **Technological Enhancements**

- **Smart Locks**: Incorporate electronic authentication methods, reducing reliance on traditional keys.
- **Alarm Systems**: Integrate alarms that trigger upon detecting tampering attempts on locks.
- **Access Control Systems**: Use electronic systems to manage and monitor access to secured areas.

#### **Physical Security Practices**

- **Regular Maintenance**: Ensure locks are in good working condition to prevent vulnerabilities caused by wear and tear.
- **Proper Installation**: Correct installation prevents easy manipulation and enhances overall security effectiveness.
- **Surveillance**: Use cameras and monitoring systems to deter and record unauthorized access attempts.

#### **Personal Insight**
