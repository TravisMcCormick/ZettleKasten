**Do you need to use setters and getters?**
- **In C++**, it’s widely considered best practice to encapsulate data members by making them private and providing public getter and setter methods. This protects invariants, allows future changes without breaking client code, and enforces validation in one place.

- **In Go**, the philosophy differs:
    - **Direct field access is the norm** when no additional logic or validation is required. Go’s design favors simplicity and readability over boilerplate. You make a field public by capitalizing its name and private by using a lowercase name.
    - **Use methods (getters/setters) only when necessary**—for example, when you need to enforce constraints, maintain invariants, or hide implementation details. If a field can be safely read or written without extra logic, simply export it and let callers access it directly.

**Idiomatic Go getters and setters**

If you do need methods, follow these conventions:

```go
// Unexported field
type Account struct {
    owner   string
    balance float64
}

// Getter: no "Get" prefix, capitalize to export
func (a *Account) Owner() string {
    return a.owner
}

// Setter: use Set prefix for methods that change state or perform validation
func (a *Account) SetOwner(name string) {
    // validation or side effects can go here
    a.owner = name
}
```

- **Getter naming**: `X()` not `GetX()`
- **Setter naming**: `SetX()`

**Summary**

- In **C++**, default to using getters and setters for encapsulation and future-proofing.
- In **Go**, default to **direct field access** for public fields; only introduce getters and setters when you need extra logic or data hiding.
