### Definition

**System Interconnects** are the communication pathways that link components within a computer system, allowing data transfer between CPUs, memory, storage devices, and peripherals.

### Types of Interconnects

- **System Bus**:
    - Main pathway for data transfer between the CPU and memory.
- **Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)**:
    - Standard for connecting peripherals to the motherboard.
- **PCI Express (PCIe)**:
    - High-speed serial computer expansion bus standard.
- **Serial ATA (SATA)**:
    - Interface for connecting storage devices.
- **Universal Serial Bus (USB)**:
    - Standard for connecting peripherals externally.
- **HyperTransport**:
    - High-speed, low-latency interconnect for integrated circuits.

### Characteristics

- **Bandwidth**:
    - The amount of data that can be transferred per unit time.
- **Latency**:
    - The delay before data transfer begins following an instruction.
- **Topology**:
    - The arrangement of interconnected components (e.g., bus, star, ring).
- **Protocol**:
    - The rules governing data transfer.

### Importance

- **Performance**:
    - Faster interconnects improve overall system performance.
- **Scalability**:
    - Allows addition of components without degrading performance.
- **Compatibility**:
    - Standard interfaces ensure interoperability between devices.

### Emerging Technologies

- **Thunderbolt**:
    - Combines PCIe and DisplayPort into one serial signal.
- **NVMe over Fabrics**:
    - Extends NVMe protocol over network fabrics for storage access.
- **Optical Interconnects**:
    - Uses light for data transfer, increasing speed and reducing latency.

### Personal Insight

**Understanding system interconnects is essential for optimizing hardware configurations**, ensuring that components communicate efficiently to meet performance requirements.
