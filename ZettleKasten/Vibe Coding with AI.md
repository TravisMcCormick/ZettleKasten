Vibe coding leverages AI to translate high-level aesthetic and experiential requirements “vibes” directly into runnable code. Instead of writing individual components or stylesheets, developers provide a mood descriptor or design sample, and the AI generates corresponding UI components, CSS variables, animations, and even underlying state-management boilerplate. This approach accelerates prototyping, enforces visual consistency, and allows non-expert contributors (designers, product managers) to iterate on interface feel without hand-crafting every element. Drawbacks include over-reliance on the model’s training distribution (risking generic outputs), potential mismatches with brand guidelines, and reduced fine-tuned control over intricate behaviors.
